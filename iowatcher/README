iowatcher graphs the results of a blktrace run.  It has a few different modes:

* Graph the result of an existing blktrace

* Start a new blktrace

* Start a new blktrace and a benchmark run

The basic options:

	-d controls which device you are string.  You can only trace one device
	   at a time for now.  It is sent directly to blktrace

	-t controls the name of the blktrace file.  iowatcher uses a dump from
	   blkparse, so -t tries to guess the name of the corresponding
	   per CPU blktrace data files if the dump file doesn't already exist.

	   If you want more than one trace in a given graph, you can specify
	   -t more than once.

	-l Sets a label for a trace file.  The labels are added in the same
	   order the trace files are added.

	-T Set a title for the graph.  This goes at the top of the image.

	-o output filename.  The default is trace.svg.  iowatcher is
	   only able to create svg for now.

	-r control the duration in seconds for the rolling average.
	   iowatcher tries to smooth out bumpy graphs by averaging the
	   current second with seconds from the past.  Longer numbers here
	   give you flatter graphs.

	-O add a single graph to the output.  By default all the graphs
	   are included, but with -O you get only the graphs you ask for.
	   -O may be used more than once.

	-N remove a single graph from the output.  This may also be used more
	   than once.

	Choices for -O and -N are:
	   io, tput, latency, queue_depth, iops

Examples:
	
	# generate graph from the existing trace.dump
	iowatcher -t trace.dump -o trace.svg
	
	# skip the IO graph
	iowatcher -t trace.dump -o trace.svg -N io

	# only graph tput and latency
	iowatcher -t trace.dump -o trace.svg -O tput -O latency

	# generate a graph from two runs, and label them
	iowatcher -t ext4.dump -t xfs.dump -l Ext4 -l XFS -o trace.svg

	# Run a fio benchmark and store the trace in trace.dump
	# add a title to the top.  Use /dev/sda for blktrace
	iowatcher -d /dev/sda -t trace.dump -T 'Fio Benchmark' -p 'fio some_job_file'
